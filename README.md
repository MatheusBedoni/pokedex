# pokedex_app

Is a projects created by Matheus bedoni using Flutter
 
## Getting Started

This application tries to emulate a pokedex, it uses https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/ as a backend to search for pokemons

This app used MVP design architecture

For state management I used GetX, I always worked with Bloc on my projects, but I wanted to work with her on this project
A very simple library compared to the Bloc

It also uses sqlite to save pokemons in the user's pokedex, sqlite has an important role here, being in list, adding and deleting pokemons

Among other libraries, if you think it's important, help me improve and say your opinion about the project
